- Accomplishments

I've accomplished several things:

* I got the chance to know a lot about the Raisl 3 public API. I have worked a lot on hooking the themes support cleanly, and not using monkey patching. 

* I also learned about testing with the minimal. In this project I am not using rspec, but test_unit, so this was different from what I was used to. 

* This time, I build the library step by step, one part at a time, which was pretty different from what I did with the twitter lib. Progressively built. I required to do design first and then coding. Leasson learned. 

* Finally, coding style. Use vertical spaces.
